A manufacturing practice project. A website for a company that develops and maintains websites.


Hello, my name is Viktor!

I'm a student at the University 'Angel Kunchev' in the city of Rousse. I'm a novice programmer with basic knowledge of web-design. My speciality is mainly HTML and CSS. I have knowledge of C++ language as well. I have some basic knowledge of JavaScript as well. 


In here, I publish the first version of my website project for the work company I'm working for during my manufacturing practice activity. This is a website for a company named 'Milev's Designs'. This company works on developing websites and also offers IT support.







Viktor Milev.
